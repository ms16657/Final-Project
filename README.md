This voice assistant works by taking the voice commands of the user and completing the required task that is set in the code.
I have had trouble syncing the Google Calendar API with the project since adding in the voice commands.
When you say "hello sam" the voice assistant wakes up and hears for your next command after introducing itself.
You can ask sam about your calendar and it is supposed to bring up any events that you may have listed in your calendar.
You can also ask sam to write down a note for you using notepad that is already programmed into the code.
If you ask sam to write a note, it will ask you what you would like written and sam will type out what you say or what the voice assitant captures in the audio message.
Ideally, this program can be used to open other apps and do other things for you to eliminate you having to do it, hence the "assistant" part.
This concludes a brief summary of the program and what this code should do.

***NOTICE: I was not able to fully get the Google Calendar API to work properly and speak out what was on the calendar or show it. I struggled trying to fix this bug and was ultimately unable to fix it.
